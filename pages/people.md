I am a member of the [Knowledge Representation & Reasoning](https://krr.cs.vu.nl/) group of the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.
The main supervisors of my PhD are: [Frank Van Harmelen](https://www.cs.vu.nl/~frankh/)  & [Michael Cochez](https://www.cochez.nl/).

Furthermore, I am a member of the [DiscoveryLabs](https://discoverylab.ai/). 
It is the product of a collaboration between the 2 universities of Amsterdam (VU & UvA) and the scientific publisher Elsevier.
