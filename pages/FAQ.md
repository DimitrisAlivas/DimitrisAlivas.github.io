Placeholder for frequently asked questions

- How to reach out for potential collaborations?
  - I'm mostly responsive via email. Either my work email (@vu.nl) or my personal email (@gmail.com). 
    Both can be found in the home page. Another way would be via my supervisors: Michael Cochez (m.cochez@vu.nl)
 and Frank Van Harmelen (frank.van.harmelen@vu.nl)
    
- What are my current topics of interest?
  - I am focused on defining hypotheses generation on scientific knowledge graphs.
  Hence, I dedicate my time to understanding the mechanics of Link Prediction over multi-relational 
  KG's, with a focus on the biomedical domain (Drug-Drug interaction, Drug-Target etc)
  - A natural continuation of that is the work on Query Answering - which can also be employed in HG.
  In the immediate future, I am looking for ways of incorporating scientific literals (temperatures, datetimes etc),
  in my KG's in order to generate hypotheses of higher complexity.
