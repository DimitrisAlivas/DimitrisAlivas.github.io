Hey there, welcome to my website. It's still under construction but you can take a look around!

I am a new-starter PhD candidate on the field of Artificial Intelligence. My ambition is to move science forward by allowing machines to assist in formulating proactive, viable, scientific hypotheses.
Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist for (almost) 3 years, gaining experience working for the industry. I gained a million soft skills and valuable lessons around how to work & organise my work, but also got the chance to work on real life challenges and practical problems over multiple domains.

In the past I have worked on the domains of life sciences (chemistry & biology), search engines, transportation engineering.
