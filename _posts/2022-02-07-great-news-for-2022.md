### Paper accepted at ICLR2022!

I am delighted to announce that one of my papers titled _StarQE: Query Embeddings on Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs_
got accepted for ICLR 2022! 



It is work done in collaboration with Max Berendorf, Michael Galkin and Michael Cochez and it is the first attempt at 
utilising query embeddings for query answering on a hyper-relational setup. Link to the repo and paper: [git](https://github.com/DimitrisAlivas/StarQE)

More to come! Stay tuned!
