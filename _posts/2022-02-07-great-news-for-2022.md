### Paper accepted at ICLR2022!

I am delighted to announce that one of my papers titled _StarQE: Query Embeddings on Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs_
got accepted for ICLR 2022! 

<img src="{{site.baseurl | prepend: site.url}}img/amaze.gif" alt="zigzag"/>


It is work done in collaboration with Max Berendorf, Michael Galkin and Michael Cochez and it is the first attempt at 
utilising query embeddings for query answering on a hyper-relational setup. Link to the repo and paper: [git](https://github.com/DimitrisAlivas/StarQE)

More to come! Stay tuned!
